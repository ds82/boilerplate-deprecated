# boilerplate #

This is my webapp boilerplate repo. It contains a basic webapp project including bootstrap, requirejs, jquery and angularjs. Packed together with a basic grunt config, bower and jshint you can clone this repo and start coding. 

# tests #

I will add testing frameworks and basic tests to the repo, soon(TM). I will use testacular and jasmine.

# backend #

Yes, I'm planing to add backend code as well.
