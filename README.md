# Boilerplate

This is my webapp boilerplate repo. It contains a basic webapp project including bootstrap, browserify, jquery and angularjs. Packed together with a basic gulp config, bower and jshint. Just clone the repo and start coding your app.

I will add more features over time and maybe transform this to a yeoman generator in the future. 

## Getting Started

1. clone the repo
2. cd into cloned repo
3. npm install
4. bower install
4. gulp
5. enjoy.

## Tests

I will add testing frameworks and basic tests to the repo, soon(TM). I will use karma and jasmine.

## Backend

Yes, I'm planing to add backend code as well.
