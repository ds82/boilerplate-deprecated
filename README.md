# Boilerplate

This is my webapp boilerplate repo. It contains a basic webapp project including bootstrap, requirejs, jquery and angularjs. Packed together with a basic grunt config, bower and jshint. Just clone the repo and start coding your app.

I will add more features over time and maybe transform this to a yeoman generator in the future. 

## Tests

I will add testing frameworks and basic tests to the repo, soon(TM). I will use karma and jasmine.

## Backend

Yes, I'm planing to add backend code as well.
